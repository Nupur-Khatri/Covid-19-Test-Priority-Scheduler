# Covid-19 Test Priority Scheduler
 Built using Machine learning tools in python, Flask and Bootstrap at the frontend that helps one determine the probability of him/her affected by the virus. It can be very useful for the medical testing staff in determining whether whom to give the priority for testing which in turn can reduces the chances of unaffected person to get affected in the queue.

<h2> My Idea for the solution of the coronavirus outbreak is: </h2>
<h3>Stop the transmission by prioritizing tests and hence detecting the cases quickly </h3>
<h3>Data can be collected on the symptoms of COVID-19.</h3>
<h3>A machine learning model is then trained on the data to find out the probability of a person having the infection.</h3>
<h3>The model is then used to find out whom to test for the infection first under a limited testing capacity.</h3>
<h3>The same model can be used to find potential candidate for conducting random tests.</h3>

<br></br>

<h2>Machine Learning model parameters:-</h2>
<h3>A team of doctors can sit down to find out the best model parameters.</h3>

<br></br>

<h2>A sample set of parameters is as follow:</h2>
<h2>Features:</h2>
<h3>Average Fever-Continous</h3>
<h3>Body Pain-0/1 Binary</h3>
<h3>Age-Discrete</h3>
<h3>Runny Nose</h3>
<h3>Breathing Problem- Categorical: 0/1/-1</h3>

<br></br>

<h2>Labels:</h2>
<h3>Probability of COVID-19 Infection</h3>

<br></br>

<h2>Steps to run the code :- </h2>
 <h3>1. Fork the respository to your account</h3>
 <h3>2. From your device clone the repository forked on your system</h3>
 <h3>3. Install these dependencies if not aldready in your system using the following command: "pip install flask pandas numpy tensorflow "</h3>
 <h3>4. Now run this command on your console for the output:  " python main.py " </h3>
